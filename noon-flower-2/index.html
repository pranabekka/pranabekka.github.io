<hr>

<p>Just a summary of my motivations, inspiration,
and the origin of the name (itâ€™s random).
See <a href="https://pranabekka.github.io/noon-flower/">my first post on Noon-Flower</a> for an introduction.</p>
<p>(Noon-Flower was previously called Wijo)</p>
<h2 id="motivations">Motivations<a class="zola-anchor" href="#motivations" aria-label="Anchor link for: motivations">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: For me, the main deciding factor for playing a game
is if I get to play it with other people.
The only one I play right now is Call of Duty on mobile,
simply because Iâ€™m able to easily get online with friends.</p>
<p><strong>Co-op</strong>: I also donâ€™t want to get into the highly competitive PvP games,
because while it feels cool to dominate,
it requires practice that takes a lot of time
and their nature can often exclude people.
I used to play Valorant and League at one point, for example,
and I was at the point where I would do target practice every day.
PvP is still alright, of course, but not the exclusive focus.</p>
<p><strong>Depth</strong>: While itâ€™s nice to play Call of Duty with friends,
I want something a little more varied sometimes.
Thatâ€™s why my concept is heavily influenced by Minecraft.
Iâ€™d like exploration, crafting, NPCs, some building, and maybe quests.</p>
<p><strong>Extensible</strong>: I think the reason Minecraft is so compelling
is that it allows you to create your own game,
and it allows this along a smooth gradient.
It can be as easy as creating a small base for yourself,
or you could go on to make a large adventure game
with custom dungeons, loot and gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Free</strong>: My options for multiplayer games with friends
can be quite limited,
because I canâ€™t expect anyone to buy games.
Also, a Libre/Open Source game should allow
further participation from the community.
Frankly, that would be really cool.</p>
<p><strong>2D, Pixel Art</strong>: This simply makes the game possible to create.
2D pixel art is easier to create,
but also easy to mock up, sketch, prototype, and reason about.
Itâ€™s effects on even generating ideas for a game
should be exponential.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration<a class="zola-anchor" href="#inspiration" aria-label="Anchor link for: inspiration">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p><strong>Minecraft</strong>: Iâ€™ve mentioned Minecraft under
the motivation points on Depth and Extensibility,
but Minecraft is basically a game engine.
It allows you to realise (a version of)
nearly any game idea you have.</p>
<p><strong>CrossCode</strong>: I found the mechanical depth of CrossCode really cool,
as well as some of the RPG elements,
like the quests and characters/story beats.
Their movement and parkour system is really cool,
and I find the overall combat system quite good as well,
even if I select upgrades pseudo-randomly.</p>
<h2 id="why-noon-flower">Why Noon-Flower?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#why-noon-flower" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-noon-flower">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Itâ€™s simple to pronounce and remember,
and doesnâ€™t have any specific meaning,
which means Iâ€™m not bound to anything specific.
Like, Minecraft is so much more than mining or crafting
â€” itâ€™s more building or auto-farming than mining
for lots of people.</p>
<p>While itâ€™s supposed to be random and meaningless,
I did imagine the game and itâ€™s (potential) community
developing a random obsession with some item called the Noon Flower.
I was picturing bases, custom maps, maybe some magic,
lore, art, and stories about some mythical/magical item.</p>
