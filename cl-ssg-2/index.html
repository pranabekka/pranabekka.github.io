<p>Following up on my initial post
(<a href="https://pranabekka.github.io/cl-ssg/">CL SSG — Common Lisp Static Site Generator</a>),
Coleslaw didn’t really work out (more below).
Instead, I’m imagining a static site generator based on
a build system,
a typst-inspired language,
and a simple server.</p>
<p>Regarding Coleslaw,
I had some bugs that I didn’t feel like going through,
plus it loaded a lot of modules I wasn’t interested in
(but not the incrememental build one?),
and I didn’t feel like learning all about it.
Even the preview didn’t work properly.
So I just let it be.
Zola gives me most of what I need anyway.
I might give Coleslaw a try again later.</p>
<p>I did look up some Common Lisp libraries, however.</p>
<p>Overlord seems to be a good build system.
It should get me incrememental and parallel builds.</p>
<p>For the authoring and templating,
I want to use a typst-like language.
Templates will simply be functions that wrap
the rest of the content.
I wonder how I’d extract metadata.
Perhaps a metadata function?</p>
<p>Hunchentoot seems to be the most popular server,
and it should be more than good enough.
I simply need to serve pages locally,
and it should be well documented,
with enough guides and references.</p>
<p>The first step is to start messing with cl-typst.
Should be as simply as evaluating anything starting with <code>,(</code>
and simply passing along anything else as regular text.
Then figure out a system for sharing state or environment?
Or should I strive to keep it functional?
Oh, well. Get the parser-evaluator figured out first.</p>
