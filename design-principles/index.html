<p>Some of the choices behind most of my designs.
I can sometimes sacrifice these, based on context,
but I adhere to them most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-first">Mobile first<a class="zola-anchor" href="#mobile-first" aria-label="Anchor link for: mobile-first">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Most users of any digital product are on mobile.
Especially if it’s a website —
even users of a desktop application
will visit a website on mobile.</p>
<p>Designing for mobile also helps figure out
what is most important in a product.</p>
<p>Also, it’s easier to spread out content
from a mobile layout to a desktop layout,
than to try to fit in the contents of
a desktop layout into a mobile screen.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-area-in-lower-half">Interactive area in lower half<a class="zola-anchor" href="#interactive-area-in-lower-half" aria-label="Anchor link for: interactive-area-in-lower-half">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Having interactive elements in the top half
requires users to move a hand to the top of the phone,
or to make awkward reaches with their thumb.</p>
<p>Instead, I put buttons
at the middle of the screen or lower.
If the user scrolls down,
buttons will also move up the screen.</p>
<h2 id="large-fonts">Large fonts<a class="zola-anchor" href="#large-fonts" aria-label="Anchor link for: large-fonts">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I use large fonts to accomodate for
conditions with hampered vision,
such as age, moving vehicles, walking, etc.</p>
<p>This usually means 14pt or 16pt for body text.</p>
<h2 id="clear-labels">Clear labels<a class="zola-anchor" href="#clear-labels" aria-label="Anchor link for: clear-labels">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Icons can often have multiple meanings,
which might not be obvious to some users,
or might even have no meaning to some people.</p>
<h2 id="large-interactive-areas">Large interactive areas<a class="zola-anchor" href="#large-interactive-areas" aria-label="Anchor link for: large-interactive-areas">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I make interactive areas roughly 44 pixels by 44 pixels or larger,
usually with a minimum of 8 pixel gaps between them.</p>
<p>This makes it easier to target for users,
without accidentally selecting the wrong element.</p>
<h2 id="consistent-interactive-element-style">Consistent interactive element style<a class="zola-anchor" href="#consistent-interactive-element-style" aria-label="Anchor link for: consistent-interactive-element-style">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I try to have a distinctive style for buttons and links
so that users immediately know
what elements can be interacted with,
and what elements are safe to select.</p>
<p>Modern UIs nowadays often have a dozen different button styles,
some of which even look like plain text.
It sometimes feels like there is no system
for what constitutes a button versus images or text.</p>
<h2 id="dark-mode">Dark mode<a class="zola-anchor" href="#dark-mode" aria-label="Anchor link for: dark-mode">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Using a website at night time, or in a dark environment,
shouldn’t subject the viewer to (sudden) brightness,
which can negatively affect
their vision, their sleep, and more.</p>
<p>For the same reason, I try to use warm colours<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>,
though people generally expect blue for interactions,
and red for negative interactions.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Night light filters do the same,
because of something to do with white or blue-ish colours.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="slightly-lowered-contrast">Slightly lowered contrast<a class="zola-anchor" href="#slightly-lowered-contrast" aria-label="Anchor link for: slightly-lowered-contrast">🔗</a></h3>
<p>100% white text on a 100% black background
can cause a “halation” effect for some users,
which means it looks like a light pointed at your eyes,
where the edges are blurry and hard to see.</p>
<p>There might be some other issues with full contrast,
but this is a good enough reason to lower it.</p>
<h2 id="lightweight">Lightweight<a class="zola-anchor" href="#lightweight" aria-label="Anchor link for: lightweight">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Websites should be usable with low network conditions,
such as being underground, or in a building.</p>
<p>This can be achieved
by only including necessary content,
and optimising images and videos.</p>
<p>For images, I compare file sizes for different formats.
Generally, I use SVGs for simple graphics and illustrations,
and PNGs or JPGs for photographs,
though the AVIF format is supposed to be the best.</p>
<p>A related idea is progressive enhancement,
where you ensure a basic version of the main content
is actually usable as is,
and then build better UI/UX on top of that.
This requires some understanding of HTML,
and interacting with the developer.</p>
<h2 id="content-first">Content first<a class="zola-anchor" href="#content-first" aria-label="Anchor link for: content-first">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The content of the page should stand out.</p>
<p>You can see it in my site design:
in each page, the title is highlighted,
and then it continues on into the body of the post.
I even sacrificed the navigation bar on top
so that the content had more space/prominence
when the user first loads a page.</p>
<h2 id="clarity-over-cleverness">Clarity over cleverness<a class="zola-anchor" href="#clarity-over-cleverness" aria-label="Anchor link for: clarity-over-cleverness">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I try to avoid clever designs,
because some users will simply be confused.
For example, it’s not really that obvious
that you must scroll up (on mobile)
to show a hidden navigation bar.</p>
<h2 id="design-annotations">Design Annotations<a class="zola-anchor" href="#design-annotations" aria-label="Anchor link for: design-annotations">🔗</a></h2>
<p>On screen buttons aren’t the only method of interaction.
Keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures
are not obvious from designs.
Designs should include annotations for these things.</p>
<p>While I don’t actually annotate things,
that’s mostly because of no particular need,
and I do consider them and explain them in writing.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility-for-everyone">Accessibility for everyone<a class="zola-anchor" href="#accessibility-for-everyone" aria-label="Anchor link for: accessibility-for-everyone">🔗</a></h2>
<p>This ties into many of the points above:
Everyone has “disabilities” of some variety
at one point or the other.</p>
<p>Injuries can reduce dexterity in the hands,
moving vehicles can hamper vision and reading,
and crowded environments impact hearing.</p>
