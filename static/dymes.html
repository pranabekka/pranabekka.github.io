<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>How many seats are available?</strong><br />
There are 6 seats.
People higher in the waitlist get 3 hours
to pay for their seats,
otherwise the next person in the waitlist gets the chance.
Once someone has attended,
they are moved to the bottom of the waitlist.</p>
<p><strong>Are the dishes vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or vegan?</strong><br />
Most dishes are vegan, or at the least vegetarian,
but it depends on the day and available ingredients.
We mark it in the menu
so that you can know before you buy your seats.</p>
<p><strong>I can’t eat any of the dishes</strong><br />
If you’ve had to skip out on meals,
feel free to send us an email with your dietary restrictions,
and we’ll adjust the next menu for you.
If only one or two dishes can’t be eaten by you,
then we might not be able to adjust,
since we make food for many people.</p>
<p><strong>My position on the waitlist went down</strong><br />
Once you’ve attended a meal,
your name goes on the bottom of the waitlist,
so that others get a chance.</p>
<p><strong>Will I get spam?</strong><br />
We only send neccessary emails,
such as the menu, a bill for your seat,
a confirmation for your seat,
and a reminder for the meal.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the meal?</strong><br />
The location is &lt;address&gt;.
We include it when we send the menu and the seat details,
and we also confirm you are nearby on sign-up.</p>
<p><strong>Can I book multiple seats?</strong><br />
You will have to let us know in advance if you want multiple seats.
On requesting, you will be put at the bottom of the waitlist,
so that others don’t get moved down the waitlist.
Keep in mind that we only have 6 seats.</p>
<p><strong>Can I share a meal with someone else on the waitlist?</strong><br />
Yes, you can.
You can send an email,
and we’ll put you in the same position on the waitlist
as the last person in your party,
so that others don’t get moved down the waitlist.
Keep in mind that we only have 6 seats.</p>
<p><strong>I’m allergic to nuts/eggs/etc.</strong><br />
If you have a specific dietary restriction
and you’re concerned about the menu,
send us an email.
We’ll let you know if the current menu is safe for you,
or we’ll avoid those ingredients in the next menu.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any additional queries
or requests for clarifications,
