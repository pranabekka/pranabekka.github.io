<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm an avid reader, and I love learning about new things.
Streamlining systems and making things work is what I enjoy most.
Paired with my knowledge of software engineering,
this makes me an ideal candidate for working with software teams.</p>

<h2>What I Can Do For You</h2>
<p>Map and simplify complex user flows
with sketches and softwares like Penpot, Figma and Adobe XD.</p>
<p>Create beautiful interfaces to match your brand and user requirements
with Penpot, Figma and Adobe XD.</p>
<p>Thoroughly research any subject area
to understand business and user requirements.</p>
<p>Have discussions with the software team
to ensure smooth implementations of the design,
as well as designs that can actually be implemented —
I'm familiar with the building blocks of the web,
such as HTML, CSS and Javascript,
and I have a basic understanding of frameworks like React, Vue and Svelte.</p>
<p>Create high quality assets for the software team,
such as SVG, Lottie, webp, etc.,
depending on requirements.</p>
