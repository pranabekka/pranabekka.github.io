Writing so much about Static Site Generators,
I want nothing other than to implement one in Common Lisp.
I get full configurability, really nice templates,
programmatic css, awesome scripting,
and anything else I might desire.

I wonder how long the build times would be, however,
if I used a shell script instead?

Alternatively, I could always try [Coleslaw](https://github.com/coleslaw-org/coleslaw).
But why Roswell.
Oh, well. I had to use it someday anyway.
