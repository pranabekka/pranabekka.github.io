AKA "RSS" feed, or Atom feed.

[Link to feed](/atom.xml)

## Why use a feed?

Say you follow a few interesting websites,
and they don't post a flood of content,
not too often, and not even on any schedule.

If you regularly find yourself
checking these sites only to find nothing,
consider using web feeds.

Web feeds allow you to see updates
to your favourite sites in one place,
with the option to view it in the same place,
and even notify you of updates.

## How does it work?

A feed is a simple link that you
put in a feed reader app,
usually by copying it.

Feed readers have varying degrees of functionality.
At a base level, they should be able to list posts
from all the people that you follow,
with a link to the post on their website.

Additional features include
viewing the post in the app,
which is fairly common,
searching all feeds and posts,
grouping them into categories,
receiving notifications on updates,
and more.

## What reader should I use?

Here's a short list of readers to get started with.
Feel free to research and find your own.

- [RSS is Awesome](https://rssisawesome.com)

  If you tend to consume content on a single device,
  use this for a free and simple reader
  with no sign-up and no ads.

- [Feed Reader](https://feedreader.com/online)

  Sign up to sync across devices,
  so that you can check your feed anywhere,
  without ads of any kind.

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com)

  Feedly is quite big and well known,
  with apps for multiple platforms,
  at the cost of ads, sponsored content,
  and other limitations for free accounts.

Ironically, I hammered out the feed
after I read a post by someone who doesn't like feeds,
despite not caring for them myself,
just because I could.

I even went through the effort of styling it with XSL,
which was the main draw for me, honestly.
