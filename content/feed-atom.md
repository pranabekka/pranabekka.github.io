AKA "RSS" feed, or Atom feed.

[Link to feed](/atom.xml)

***

For the uninitiated,
web feeds are a mechanism for sharing updates,
because websites don't really have a specific structure.
It's a special link (mine is above)
that goes into a feed reader application,
of which there are several.
Here's a few:

- [RSS is Awesome](https://rssisawesome.com)

  If you tend to consume content on a single device,
  use this for a free and simple reader
  with no sign-up and no ads.

- [Feed Reader](https://feedreader.com/online)

  This is similar to the above service,
  but with a required account
  for syncing across multiple devices.

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com)

  Feedly is quite big and well known,
  with apps for multiple platforms,
  at the cost of ads, sponsored content,
  and other limitations for free accounts.

Ironically, I hammered out the feed
after I read a post by someone who doesn't like feeds,
despite not caring for them myself,
just because I could.

I even went through the effort of styling it with XSL,
which was the main draw for me, honestly.
