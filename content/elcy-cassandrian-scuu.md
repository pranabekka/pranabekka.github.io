Quod Olim Erat (Battleship Chronicles #1 on Amazon)
is an incredibly realistic, detailed, believable
and intense take on military sci-fi.

As I was imagining what Halo's
story and depictions could have been,
it kept sounding like Quod Olim Erat,
so I thought I'd give the book
and its sequels a recommendation.

[Quod Olim Erat by Lise Eclaire, on Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat)

In Quod Olim Erat, and its two sequels,
you follow a ship A.I. that re-enters military service
in a human-like body, after being retired for decades.

The alien wars on both frontiers is still ongoing,
and Elcy has to deal with people keeping secrets,
her own redacted memories,
complex politics surrounding (un)retired ships,
concerns about her going rogue,
and mysterious alien artifacts.

**NOTE:** The books in the series were
published on Amazon and Kindle (around April 22, 2024) [^1],
which means the Royal Road versions are now stubbed.
You can read the previews for free, and if you like it,
buy it for pretty cheap (that too by Indian standards)
under the "Battleship Chronicles" name.
