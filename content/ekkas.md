Bridal accessories website design and live concept.

[See Live Concept](/ekkas.html)

When I showed [Dyme's](@/dymes.md) to my mum and aunts,
it turned out they'd been talking about a little
bridal accessories business the other day,
so we discussed it a little bit,
and I just mocked up another website in the same vein.

![Screenshot of website on mobile.
The website title says "Ekkas'",
and subtitle says
"We make tasteful bridal accessories."
Below the subtitle are three icons:
a head with a veil on it,
a basket, and a set of flowers.
Under the icons is the text
"Veils, flower baskets, and bouquets."
Further below are two buttons for Call and Message,
with the Call button more prominent,
and a placeholder number (8765487654) below them.
Under that you can see an image of a bouquet,
and further below is cut off text saying "Pricing"
in larger bold font (a heading).](/ekkas.png)

Like [Dyme's](@/dymes.md),
I tried to make something simple and easily achievable.
The CTA here encourages calling
because the deliverables are more complex,
and it makes sense to work out everything.
I also show the contact information separately,
so that people can share it easily.
The final versions of the two websites (this and Dyme's)
could use a separate share button as well.
