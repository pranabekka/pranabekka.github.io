A brief introduction to me and the site,
including tips on how to use it (the site, not me ;).

## About Me

Where me = "Pranab".

I have a formal education in design,
with my current focus on UI/UX design,
but I've also had an interest in computers since school,
starting with Scratch and the like.

Some of my interests include:

- Reading: especially (science) fiction,
  but I read a lot of blog posts on various subjects,
  though I find good tech blogs the easiest to find.
- UI/UX Design: I've been looking into accessibility lately,
  and I quite enjoy a brutalist/swiss/functional style
  that relies more on text,
  though I try to infuse some popular aesthetics into it
  and play around with other styles.
- Writing:
  that's how I maintain this blog ;)
  I can write nonsense about whatever's going on in my head,
  but also notes on things I read or ideas I have,
  as well as short snippets of fiction.
  I might write a book someday.
- Shell Scripting: I'm fairly proficient
  in using the (Fish) shell and scripting,
  and I have a few small utilities I use here and there.
- Programming: I have a decent grasp of most concepts,
  and I can navigate code well enough,
  even if I don't know the language,
  but I haven't written or maintained
  a decently sized codebase.

## About the Site

Built Using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org)
(Static Site Generator)

Custom theme made by me.
See choices below.

- "zettelkasten"-like
  - no categories
    - could add tags in the future?
  - backreferences
    - posts link to each other
  - flat structure
- 8px gap between interactive elements
  (where possible)
- large-ish font size for people with poor eyesight
- no "flashbang": dark theme
  - might make a light theme eventually
- avoid full black/white to reduce glare effect (halation).
  not sure what other issues it might cause
- show all posts in single page to make basic search easy
- three heading levels
  - inspired by edward tufte
  - not a hard rule, but easy to stick to
- number headings to match list of contents ("table of contents")
- rounded inline code to show start and end,
  especially when spanning multiple lines (on mobile)
- higher contrast for smaller areas
  - highlight colour is brighter when used in underlines,
    than the colour used in the title
- "logo" in header and tab title to make pages from site apparent
- no custom fonts (imports) to save on page size and loading time

### Usage Tips

- index is a good place to search the site
  - it shows *all* posts, though only title and first paragraph
- search using `site:pranabekka.github.io <search term>`
  (works with major search providers)
- references to current page appear at the bottom
  - other related pages appear in the body
