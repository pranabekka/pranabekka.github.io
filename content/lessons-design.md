These are my takeaways from
"The musings of a designer and what he loves
about design and what he's learned along the way" (2023)
by Fabricio Teixeira.
I found it full of practical and actionable advice and
I recommend you read the whole article yourself:

[lessons.design](https://lessons.design/)

## Takeaways

I don't quite understand what frameworks is about,
and I understand and appreciate
the points on simplicity and consistency a fair bit,
but my biggest takeaway is on framing:

You should present your idea
as a starting quote, image, video, metaphor,
or *something* to introduce the idea to your audience.
See the emphasised points under
[the section on framing](#framing) for more.

### framework

- have a model/framework  for the
product. to represent and understand the
 subject of the product. this should not
 change as the product evolves, and
should keep the product consistent
- identify and emphasise the core
differentiating factor  of your
framework. make it incredibly obvious
- don't stick to preconceived notions of
 the problem/subject area
- test concepts by making prototypes
with exaggerated differences
- make frameworks and get inspiration
from beyond design

### simplicity

- if two things are similar, bring them
 closer, merge them, or separate them
further
- whitespace is for the eyes to rest and
 absorb things
- descriptions with "and" or "also"
suggest that the product is doing too
much
- words and writing can merge things
together, make them shorter, make them
less generic

### framing

If you read the article a second time,
you'll see that he uses these ideas
at the beginning of the page,
as well at the beginning of every chapter.

- frame the product such that you
present your reasoning and make it
apparent to people
- learn to see the rationale behind
designs, to learn how to frame your own
- *you can frame a product with a
conceptual word, an image, an animation,
 a video, a short sentence, a metaphor,
a drawing, a framework, a datapoint, a
quote*
- don't just describe the layout of the
product (which is already visible).
describe how it will benefit users, how
it reaches business goals, the reasoning
 behind it
- *framing gives people time, context and
 insight about the design, which makes
it easier to understand*

### consistency

- consistency means designing for the
future --- not just for present delight
or use
- consistency helps users as well as
creators (team)
- double check work to ensure quality,
consistency
- don't pursue consistency in the face
of context
- the people you work with will last
longer than the products you work on.
joy in that is what lasts
