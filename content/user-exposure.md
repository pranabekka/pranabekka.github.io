Designers should be directly exposed to users
(as opposed to only relying on reports
from a dedicated user research team).
Notes on article by Center Centre.

[Fast Path to a Great UX â€“ Increased Exposure Hours](https://articles.centercentre.com/user_exposure_hours)

Amount of time spent with a user/users
is more important than the number of research participants.

At least two hours every six weeks is best,
since it reinforces learnings.

All team members (not just designers and developers)
should be exposed to users to get the whole team on board.

Field visits are especially helpful for initial exposure.
Usability tests can be made based on pain points recorded from field visits.
Don't rely completely on remote testing.
Observing users with competing products is also helpful.

Field visits, as defined:
"interview the user, uncover their goals and objectives,
and then ask them to use the product or service to accomplish those."
