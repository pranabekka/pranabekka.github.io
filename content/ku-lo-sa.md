KU LO SA by Oxlade and Camila Cabello

I've been into whatever this genre is lately:
Nigerian hip hop, I guess.

It started with Wetin by Yarden,
followed by KOLO by Ice Prince and Oxlade (amongst others),
though I've liked Jamaican Patois for a while,
and I've been listening to African-origin rappers
from the US and UK for even longer.
I even enjoyed the Patois bits from Top Boy a lot.

My favourite bit is the chorus at the end.
Makes me just play the song again.
It's simply so upbeat and makes me want to dance
even while I'm walking along in front of other people.
