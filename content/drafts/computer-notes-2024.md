## Files and apps

Files contain information.
You save information in files.

Apps allow you to open, change, and save files.

Different types of files contain different types of information.

A spreadsheet or worksheet contains a table of data and formulas.

The default app for a spreadsheet is Excel.
Spreadsheets have information about cells in a table,
and formulas that calculate things from those cells,
like a sum of total marks, or average marks, or percentage.
There are more apps that can open and save spreadsheets.
This is true for all types of files.

For example, a picture file can be created with a camera,
it can be created from the Paint app,
and it can be opened in the Photos app.

There are also different types of picture files.
A PNG file has a transparent background.
A JPG file does not.
They can both be opened in the Photos and Paint apps.

A document type file opens in Word by default.
Document files contain mainly text,
but also pictures, simple tables (no formulas and sorting),
page numbers, headings, automatic lists, and more.
It is useful for writing documents you want to print,
such as report cards, text books, story books, and more.

A text document file opens in Notepad by default.
It only saves the letters that you type.
All text is the same font and size,
and it does not save the font, the font size, or anything else.
It does not have advanced features like pictures and tables.
It is useful when you're writing some notes or simple information.
It also opens much faster than Document files in Word.

A presentation or "slide deck" opens in Powerpoint by default.
A presentation is a series of "slides"
that contain text, images, charts, and more.
They are used when giving a lecture on something
in a meeting or classroom.

A "file folder" opens in File Explorer by default.
It contains a list of other files.
They are used for organising your files.
For example, any files you saved during computer class
could be saved in "Computer Training - Pranab".

## How to open an app

There are two main ways of opening an app.

You can open it from the app icon.

You can open a file in the app.
When you open a file with double click,
it automatically opens in the default app.

All app icons are shown in the start menu.
Some app icons are "pinned" to the taskbar.

## Tabs

Tabs are like multiple windows,
but in the same windows.
Some apps have tabs, but most don't.
Tabs can be dragged out to make a separate window,
and they can also be dragged onto different windows.

In Notepad, tabs are for different files.

In Chrome, Edge, and Firefox,
tabs are for different websites.

In File Explorer, tabs are for different folders.

Tabs are created by clicking the plus button
next to the last tab.
To close them, click the cross inside the tab.
To move them, drag the tab.
