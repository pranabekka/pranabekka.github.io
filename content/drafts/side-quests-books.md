praise for super supportive by sleyca

[Super Supportive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63759/super-supportive)

games often have a main quest line, as well as side-quests
the side-quests don't progress the main story line
but they provide some satisfaction

the quality of sleyca's book gives a similar experience
there are so many little details for you to uncover
and even perspectives of different situations

i frequently go diving through previous chapters

sometimes it starts with a recollection as i'm reading
other times i'm just sitting around and i think about the book
or maybe i'm browsing through the comments and something strikes me
then i'll go to the index and open all relevant chapters,
and as i'm reading another detail will stick out for me
so i'll make a note of that or open it in a new tab

note well: i keep a single file on my phone,
and another on my laptop, as well as a pocket-sized notebook,
where i write down anything i feel like
and separate them by day,
so taking notes on super supportive is trivial for me

the richness of sleyca's writing gives you information
even when you go back and re-read a chapter
re-reading the same chapter can often be quite enjoyable in itself
you gain some enjoyment from the scenes themselves,
but then you also uncover little details
that you missed the first time

these don't progress the main story in any way,
because that's what happens when you read the next chapter
but you can go digging th

it's easiest to do this with web novels and physical books
you can trivially open chapters in a new tab or window
or put bookmarks and notes in between pages

although, for me, a big part of it is
wanting to read the next chapter so bad
that i go through all the comments,
which makes me think more about the book.
i personally don't like overthinking a book,
but it doesn't feel like that to me,
and i enjoyed the book as is
even as i was devouring the first 100 chapters or so
