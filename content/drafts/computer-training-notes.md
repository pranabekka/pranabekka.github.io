## day 3

### setup

- get large board
- draw review images with space for names:
	mouse, window, windows, cursor, file, folder,
	windows key, desktop, on/off (i didn't cover; is it even visible?)
- draw touchpad, start menu, taskbar

### pre-class hangout

sit down at a laptop and ask what they want to do.

get feedback:
- did they want to do something else?
- was it hard to follow?
- anything they're still uncertain about

### review

ask name for each image

re: Windows, they should see it on startup

### continue

- ask what they'd like to do.
- first, we'll cover three new terms:
	touchpad, start menu, taskbar
- then i'll spend some time with everyone
	doing what they'd like,
	and helping do things better.
	advanced people should sit together.
	divide 40 minutes by number of groups.

## remaining setup

- location off

- search icon

- hindi phonetic keyboard has lots of value

  should i set it up or give them instructions?
  instructions will need to cover terms first.
  oh, it'll need network connectivity. damn.
  will need to take it to the office one day.

## terms

note:
remember to ask them for their own terms for things.
we can note that down and include it in the notes.

### intro

before we get into today, i want to ask two questions.
anyone can answer.

#### questions

1. "window kya hota hai?" (singular window)
2. "windows kya hota hai?" (plural windows)
(the point here is knowing names)

this is why names are important.
we need to know what the other person is talking about.
you need to know what i'm saying,
and i need to know what you're saying.

#### answers

window:
- app windows.
  phone has "full screen" apps.
  draw a phone to scale with laptop screen

windows:
- multiple app windows
- settings, appearance, basic apps.
  advanced apps and files are not windows.
- keyboard key
<!--
these will be covered later:
(people won't know these terms)
  desktop, start menu, settings, taskbar, main look,
  main apps, and everything other than apps.
-->

#### importance of names

the advanced people might know this,
in which case they can do whatever they like.
in one or two days, i will sit down with them.
however, i think learning these terms will be useful.

(if i have basics ready, give advanced (touch?) typing challenge,
with a speed display or something.
could also give them quickqwerty,
which has a simple zip download.
these skills will transfer to all apps,
and help you write faster.
see who does best.
i can give a quick demo)

(before that i will sit down with everyone
and do a little typing test,
to see how comfortable they are.)


### files and folders

everyone knows apps. what about files and folders?

(draw folder icon, file icons)
(draw tree view)

phone: search for file app

```
downloads/
dcim/ (digital camera images)
pictures/
  whatsapp/
documents/
```

laptop: search for file app.
name: file explorer.

(need to explain local disk c and disk d)
laptop storage.
divide into shelves?
(draw a laptop at the root of the tree)
(they won't know cd,
plus disk explanation is long and convoluted)

special folder on laptop:
```
desktop/
```

apps work with files
some apps hide their files
on mobile, most hide their files


### os / operating system

what controls settings, which settings, how many settings,
available apps, file locations, menus for things like wifi,
appearance, etc

how keyboard or screen presses are detected

phone has android
laptops have windows
heard of iphone? those phones have ios


### windows

operating system

windows 10, windows 11
sanathan sir's is windows 10
this changes look, and where some things are

draw logos for both with version number
10 is perspective, 11 is rounded

they know how versions work


### desktop

icons, background image

"desk", "table"


### taskbar

start menu, search, pinned taskbar apps, active apps,
quick settings, (bg?) icons, date-time, notifications,
system status (battery, network)


### quick settings


### start menu


### window, windows

the app windows


### title bar

window actions: min, max, close


### mouse, trackpad, cursor

cursor shapes
cursor ~= mouse in usual speak


### windows key

shortcuts


### minimise, maximise, close


### "task" view

  basically app/window view?
  also includes "virtual desktops"
