My notes on getting a license and driving cars,
based on my lessons and attempts this year.
Some parts apply to driving outside India as well.

**NOTE:** Pay attention to your instructor,
and don't try to do more than they tell you.
Reading is not the same as practice.

Use the license application knowledge
to get yourself a license at a much cheaper cost
than doing it through a school,
and use the driving knowledge
to supplement your other lessons and understanding.

## How it Works

- ll app
- written test
- get ll
- lessons/practice
- dl app
- written? + practical test
- get dl

in practice you can attend lessons
to help you with your written test
and they will also give you practical test
even without an ll
i thought it was a driving school allowance,
but i'm not so sure

## Applying for Learner's License

5kb file limit or something
make sure
it just gives an "invalid page" error
instead of file size error

## Driving

There are 5 main things to concern yourself with
in the beginning:
At your hands is the steering wheel,
at your left is the gear shift,
and at your feet are the accelerator, brake and clutch.

gears:
- 1: starting up
- 2: 1-20 kmph
- 3: 20-30 kmph
- 4: 30-40 kmph
- 5: 40-50+ kmph

why gears:
rpm, stressing out the engine, inertia,
gear sizes (small spins faster, cause less work per spin)

changing by feel:
shuddering/struggling vs little/no resistance\
uhoh, not sure which is which

don't bother changing unless you're about to change soon anyway

### Take-off

Releasing the clutch creates some motion itself.
Release it gently and press the accelerator slowly.

If you're on a slope, facing up, hold the break,
and release it slowly at the same time as the clutch.
The moment the car seems steady,
or even moving up a bit,
switch your right foot from the break
to the accelerator.

### Stopping

Put the gear in neutral before leaving the clutch.

Basically, the gears should not be engaged
unless you're holding down the clutch and/or accelerator.
