## Not the web

some people might compare this to the web

no legacy, better design

colour systems for styling

static documents

safe scripting
which word doesn't have
might've seen how it doesn't trust documents

## A document's journey

A document is born from an idea
expressed in a paragraph.
The author simply writes.
They add lists and tables.
Images. Video.

Then the author divides it into sections by adding headings.
They move paragraphs, headings and whole sections around.

Finally, they add a title along with their name.

The author then shares their document as a web page.
The text is easily readable on phones.
The font size adapts to the needs of the reader.
Users that struggle to read can listen to it instead.
The computer tells them
if it's a heading, paragraph, or something else.
They can choose how it reads the document to them.

If the author wants to publish a print book,
the can use the default styles,
or pick a nice one from the internet.
They can trivially switch through themes
and use the one that they like.

If the author is publishing an academic paper,
they can download the recommended styles
and simply apply them to their document.

If the author is working with an editor or publisher,
they can share the structure of the document
in a format that they accept.
An editor can focus on the content,
and a publisher can style it better
since they don't need to remove any styles.

## The current generation

The author first waits for their editor to load,
then they are greeted with a giant panel
that hides all the other giant panels.

Then they load a default font that's quite ugly,
changing any of which is a trial by menu.
Have you ever tried updating document styles?

Finally, they're stuck with the largely irrelevant assumption
that the document has to be the size of a US letter
because it is going to be printed on paper.
