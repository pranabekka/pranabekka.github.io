Most services don't require them.

The core service is always independent of an account.
The account usually adds functionality for specific use cases,
but once it's added in,
business owners are always tempted to add in extra things,
like tracking your usage [^1] and
and sending you emails about everything under the sun.
Some companies will even sell it to others,
so that you can actually be scammed and pestered
for the rest of your life.

[^1]: and then they're tempted to try it
even when you're not logged in.

Imagine if the local grocery store required
you to login with your name and number every time.
Sure, it would be helpful if there was a
discrepancy in the bill, amount paid, or goods provided,
and maybe if you forgot something,
but how much value does it add?
Especially for the shopkeeper?
The main reason to have accounts
would be to message you about every new product
and offer they can think of,
so that you could be tempted to visit again.
That's what lots of larger stores do.

If a web service requires an account,
and it doesn't contribute to the core service,
then I simply don't use the service.

If a cashier asks you for your phone number,
just say "No, thank you."

It'll improve your life.
You'll be able to focus on the messages that matter,
such as transaction details from your bank
or a government service notifying you
when your appointment is.
