Things that would make an ideal game for me.

- Multiplayer.

  I've had the most fun with multiplayer games.
  Most of the singleplayer games I've played
  have also been shared experiences.
  We used to play games on the same computer,
  and even now we play some games on each others computers,
  and we watch each other and discuss the game.

- Beginner friendly.

  I want to play for fun with friends,
  and I want to make it accessible for everyone.

- Free.

  I can't expect everyone to purchase a game.
  Especially when I'm generally broke myself.

- Free* and open sauce.

  Sounds like a good way to build a community,
  in my opinion.
  Allows people to play with the internals
  and collaborate as well.

  \* as in freedom

I also have some smaller points that relate to the above,
but they're not foundational principles.

- Co-operative play.

  Beginners will not have fun
  if they're pitted against higher-skilled players.

  This can also be mixed in with PvP
  in the form of team-based games,
  including battle-royales.
  See the point on LAN multiplayer, though.

- Directional movement.

  Directly controlling a character is more immersive.
  I think it creates a link between you and the character,
  and makes you a part of the world,
  instead of ruling over it with clicks and drags.

- 2D movement.

  Have you ever yelled at someone to "look left",
  then "right!", then "wait! stop! now slowly turn left!"?

  Even if the graphics are 3D, as long as movement is 2D,
  it means that directions will always have the same meaning.

  This contributes to being beginner friendly.

- Top-down.

  We navigate in the physical world and 3D games
  using discrete floors.
  Additionally, movement in all directions remains consistent.
  In a platformer game, jump is much more complex
  than simply moving in a given direction
  in a top-down game.

  This also contributes to being beginner friendly.

- LAN multiplayer.

  When I play with friends,
  I'm often hanging out with them,
  and it's nice to see and hear reactions in person.

  Also, online multiplayer means servers,
  although peer-to-peer might help reduce costs.

- Minigames.

  They're fun!
  They add some variety and extra depth to the game.

- Mobile friendly.

  It's just easier to get started,
  and people carry phones everywhere.

- Web technologies.

  It's the easiest way to support several devices,
  and distributing iOS apps is really tough.

- Storage space efficient.

  This is a part of making games accessible to more people,
  because download sizes for games these days are huge,
  which can make people reluctant to download it,
  or even unable to, because of unavailable space.

  This can be achieved with pixel art,
  simple 2D art, or low poly 3D art.

- "Pretty."

  Aesthetics matter to people,
  and they likely won't try something if
  it doesn't at least look interesting.
