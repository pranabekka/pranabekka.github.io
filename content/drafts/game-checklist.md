Things that would make an ideal game for me.


## Main

### Multiplayer

I've had the most fun with multiplayer games.
Most of the singleplayer games I've played
have also been shared experiences.
We used to play games on the same computer,
and even now we play some games on each others computers,
and we watch each other and discuss the game.

### Beginner friendly

I want to play for fun with friends,
and I want to make it accessible for everyone.

### Free

I can't expect everyone to purchase a game.
Especially when I'm generally broke myself.

### Open sauce

Sounds like a good way to build a community,
in my opinion.
Allows people to play with the internals
and make the game their own.

## Additional

I also have some smaller points
that are mostly derived from the above.

### Co-operative play

Beginners will not have fun
if they're pitted against higher-skilled players.

This can also be mixed in with PvP
in the form of team-based games,
including battle-royales[^royale].

[^royale]: See the point on LAN multiplayer, though.

### Directional movement

Directly controlling a character is more immersive.
I think it creates a link between you and the character,
and makes you a part of the world,
instead of ruling over it with clicks and drags.

### Non-action/combat games

"Action"[^action] games are unintuitive for some people,
and can make them immediately lose interest.

Combat games like shooters are also unappealing to some.

Alternatives include:

- Racing games
- Card games like UNO
- Board games like ludo
- Puzzle games
- Matching games like Candy Crush
- Deck-building games like Slay the Spire
- Word games like Crossword, boggle, and Wordle

One point in favour of "action"[^action] games
is that they provide a consistent and repeatable interface
that can be used in a large variety of contexts.

[^action]: action games in the sense of
controlling a character directly
and making it take actions in the world.

## Playable lobby

The waiting room should be a fully playable space.

This way people can do something other than
staring at a menu while they wait for each other.

You can also put gameplay tips and a tutorial area there
so that all players can brush up on the mechanics,
and experienced players can guide beginners through.

### 2D movement

Have you ever yelled at someone to "look left",
then "right!", then "wait! stop! now slowly turn left!"?

Even if the graphics are 3D, as long as movement is 2D,
it means that directions will always have the same meaning.

This contributes to being beginner friendly.

### Top-down

We navigate in the physical world and 3D games
using discrete floors.

Additionally, movement in all directions remains consistent.
In a platformer game, jump is much more complex
than simply moving in a given direction
in a top-down game.

This also contributes to being beginner friendly.

### LAN multiplayer

When I play with friends,
I'm often hanging out with them,
and it's nice to see and hear reactions in person.

Also, online multiplayer means servers,
although peer-to-peer might help reduce costs.

### Minigames

They're fun!
They add some variety and extra depth to the game.

### Mobile friendly

It's just easier to get started,
and people carry phones everywhere.

### Web technologies

It's the easiest way to support several devices,
and distributing iOS apps is really tough.

Could collaborate with iOS users, if they have a Mac,
and you're working on a game that needs it,
such as something with 3D or higher graphics.

### Storage space efficient

This is a part of making games accessible to more people,
because download sizes for games these days are huge,
which can make people reluctant to download it,
or even unable to, because of unavailable space.

This can be achieved with pixel art,
simple 2D art, or low poly 3D art.

### "Pretty"

Aesthetics matter to people,
and they likely won't try something if
it doesn't at least look interesting.

### Trial round

If making a party game or something with lots of minigames,
have a way to run a trial round to experience
a round of each minigame.

### In-game wiki

Information about game systems
should be available in the game.

Preferably with images and animations.
These can be made with in-game assets,
and could even be made interactable!

In a top-down 2D game,
this could even be written on the floor,
and the player could move around
or use buttons in the game-world
to change what they're viewing.

### Interactive tutorial

Don't force a tutorial
where control is taken away from the player.

In a 2D game, you can achieve this
by having tutorial text and images
on the floor or wall.

You can also use "holographs"
that depict a character or player
taking a specific path,
performing some actions,
or using various controls.

### Show controls

Show the available controls to the player.

on desktop, show the keys and mouse actions in a corner.

on mobile, make the buttons have the expected icons.
