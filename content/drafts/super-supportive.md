While I'm suggesting books,
I might as well recommend my current favourite ---
Super Supportive by Sleyca.

I'm failing to come up with words right now. 
Umm...

(Begin intense E.A. announcer voice) \
In a world. \
Where super heroes are real life humans. \
Who aren't super edgy and dark. \
Who achieve their feats through magic. \
Gifted in the early 80s by aliens. \
With a young, mature, and likable protagonist. \
Introducing, Super Supportive!

(Resume normal voice) \
I don't know how to describe it.
I had words a few days ago, but I've forgotten them.

It's incredibly well written and considered.

It can be compared to Worm in some ways,
but it's not even half as edgy and dark (yet, I guess),
the protagonist is not a victim of intense bullying,
the rest of the world exists before halfway through the book,
and the aliens peacefully co-exist,
even coming to Earth to gift magic
(and computers, according to some people).

I can't really describe it,
but as you read on,
you'll discover more about the world,
humanity right now,
aliens and their cultures,
and the people that occupy that world
(including non-human people).
