Book Club was born out of a simple thought:
"Once I buy a book and read it,
it just lies on my shelf
and isn't touched again for ages."
What if we set up a community for exchanging books?
So I took to designing what it might look like.

Book Club, the software, would be something
that anyone could configure and deploy
to host their own little book club,
named whatever they like.
In these mockups, I call it "Ranchi Book Club",
because a lot of my family is here,
and we're all heavy readers.

<!--
The premise is simple:
You loan your books for other people to read,
and you borrow other people's books to read yourself.
This way, nobody truly parts with their books,
and their books also get some love and attention.
-->

Ranchi Book Club is invite based.
Members of the community want to ensure
that their books will be treated well,
and that they won't just be stolen or mistreated.

<!--
When I started thinking about how to
actually get this community off the ground,
I figured making a whole website from scratch
would not be the optimal path.
Instead I considered

...

Funnily enough, thinking about the book club
and some other things
made me design a forum as well as [PubNotes](@/pubnotes.md).
