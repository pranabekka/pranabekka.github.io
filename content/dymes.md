My aunt's cooking is better than the restaurants
I've eaten from in Ranchi and Khunti
(perhaps excepting Radison Blu).
So I thought that her food should be shared with people,
and this website design is a result of that idea.

I even made an actual webpage
that you should check out :D

I worked especially to make the idea achievable,
instead of a fancy restaurant menu or dashboard.

You can get a better understanding
if you scroll through the [website concept](/dymes.html).

The site design is super simple,
things are operated by email,
and I put a lot of thought into the overall system,
such as the number of seats and the waitlist.
I'll probably write about it in more detail in a separate post.
