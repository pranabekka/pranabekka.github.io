This is a musing about [apenwarr's post](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=202304)
on AI and magic, and related things.
It's more of an idea I had related to it.

As I was going about my day, I just thought:
I thought "this is about interfaces".
There are good interfaces, and there are bad interfaces.
And so, there are good kinds of magic, and there are bad kinds.
Sometimes, the magic will transport you back home from work
in the blink of an eye.
Inside a wall. Not good.
But there is good magic as well, so it's okay.
