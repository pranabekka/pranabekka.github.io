And also a source of great pain.

For the last few months,
I open a tab at least two days a week,
and I refresh it every few minutes or hours,

Introducing: Super Supportive by Sleyca.

[Super Supportive on Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63759/super-supportive)

I've been reading it for so long
that I'm not sure I can pinpoint exactly what I felt
when I started reading it,
but I can promise you this:
it's incredibly well written,
the world is rich, believable, and large,
and the main character is very likable.
