We have some solid numbers to compare.

## Spoiler severity warning

There are references to information till chapter 189,
which is from 15th December 2024,
but if Alden is back on Earth for you,
I've taken to only have miniscule spoilers.
If he _isn't_ back on earth, _major_ spoiler ahead.

If you haven't read the book,
you might want to read it first.

You can still read past this point
if you don't care too much about spoilers.
I feel the biggest reason to read Super Supportive
is all the little details that make up
the world and the characters.

## Spoilers lie ahead

In 156, we learn Ella-Clara got an impressive four levels.

In 189, we find out Morrisson Walker
gets two to three levels a year "like a teenager".

Before this, we knew his real levels were epic,
but we had a vague idea his fake levels were decent.

In 64, a woman says three levels and a star is impressive,
but that's really all we knew until 156.

In 78, a guy said Alden must have hidden and trained for a year.

Only the system knows Alden is level 9.
They were both talking about his four levels,
though the woman might have cared more about the star.

156 is the first concrete number we got
to compare Alden's levelling to,
but we all got distracted by different things.

If you haven't connected the dots yet,
this is what this post is about.

### The meat

To the world, Alden got three levels
in _half_ a year off Earth.

If more people knew his _actual_ level of eight,
mystery-moon-man is going to give people meltdowns.

In 105, we learn Alden has earned two levels in two months,
which means a level a month,
which means six levels in six months,
which means twelve levels in a year. [^calc]

[^calc]: Even with a high error margin,
we know Alden's authority sense
and use of free and bound authority accelerates his growth,
so it's fair to assume
this is the _minimum_ speed for his levelling.

I get tingles just thinking about it.

Even if that's cut in half for his fake profile,
that means people would see six levels in a year. [^plans]

[^plans]: Alden's plans from 105 suggest
he'll only increase it by a level in a few months,
but it's just so exciting to think about
people seeing his fake profile go up six levels a year.

When he updates his profile,
what will people think when they find out?

What's Aulia Velra going to do?

Could the Knights or other Wizards find out?

What would Gemma "the Gloom" Elber's perspective be?

What about Morrisson I-hope-the-kid-catches-bullets Walker?

What about Torsten one-skill-is-not-enough Klein?

Even the students are going to learn of his levels.
Poor Mehdi would actually lose his mind.
They'll all want to know his secrets.

AAAAaaahhhhh!
There's going to be so much juicy drama!
The tingles simply don't stop!

I can't even imagine what the reveal of
his real profile will be like.

When will the cost of "lying" be too much for the system?
Probably quite a bit,
given that he's basically a Knight
and Artona I likes him,
but he'll eventually have to reveal it.

So much strangeness.
So much tingling in my bones.

_I want to time travel to more chapters **so bad**._
