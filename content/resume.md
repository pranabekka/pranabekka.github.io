Hi! I try out (or note down) design concepts almost daily,
and I love reading books, as well as learning about new things.
Streamlining systems and making things work
(or theorising how to) is what I enjoy most.
Paired with my knowledge of software engineering,
this makes me an ideal candidate for working with
software teams.
