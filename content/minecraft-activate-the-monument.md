I was watching the 9th devlog of Space64 (WIP name)
by FireDragon04, and as he talked about activating
the doorway by enabling beacons,
I thought about Minecraft beacons, and a spin on
the Minecraft CTM (Complete the Monument) formula
where you activate beacons instead of fetching wool
and returning it to the monument.
A Minecraft ATM. (Activate the Monument. Hah.)

I'd say the main difference is that
loosing a monument key is now impossible,
since they don't exist.
This is usually solved by regenerating the keys,
or making ways to keep your inventory,
or preventing your items from despawning,
which is no longer required.

Perhaps it will feel like less of a fetch quest?

I know I want to recreate FireDragon04's game
in Minecraft, at least a general vibe.
I'm a fan of Halo, sci-fi, brutalism,
and grand buildings.
I can just imaging the whole thing
as a ~~Complete the Monument~~ Activate the Monument.
I even have vague ideas of progression, dungeons,
gameplay, grand architecture and the ending in mind.
