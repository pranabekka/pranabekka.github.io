Low sci-fi speculative micro-fiction

***

Oh! That's cold!

I suddenly felt little cold spots on my face.

It was you, and you asked me to trust you.

My gear is now off.

Now we're sitting outside, silently,
thoughts racing, or blanking out,
our hands intertwined;
and this is nice, but I'm not sure if I'd do it again.

It took a while to adjust after taking off the wear.
My eyes aren't watering anymore,
but it still feels weird.
Everything does --- a bit.

I don't think I could do this again.

I love you.

The basic concept is a society
where headgear is a thing,
and people live completely
in virtual/augmented space.
