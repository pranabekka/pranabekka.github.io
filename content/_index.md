Hello world.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet,
where I overshare about my faffing around.
Topics include Linux, programming, and design;
amongst other things.

This site is basically a content dump,
where everything is free to intermingle
according to my whims.
The basic idea is to have it organised like
a [Zettelkasten (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten),
which I've done by removing hierarchies and categories,
and enabling backlinks.
This page simply lists everything from
the most recent to the first.

My favourites are [Lispy Templates](@/lispy-templates.md),
[Do More in Your Minecraft Worlds](@/minecraft-enhanced.md)
and [DIY (Fish) Shell Templating](@/shell-templating.md).
