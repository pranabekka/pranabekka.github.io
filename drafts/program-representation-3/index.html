<p>as text, blocks, and nodes, <em>at the same time</em></p>
<p>i think i’ve struck a balance between
text programming and visual programming
that allows seamless translation and collaboration
between the two representations and their users.</p>
<h2 id="a-case-for-both">a case for both<a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-case-for-both" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-case-for-both">🔗</a></h2>
<p>text programming is hard for beginners
because they need to learn multiple skills —
one of which is typing out all the syntax correctly
while also trying to understand programming concepts.
also, most users are more comfortable
with the mouse or touchscreen.</p>
<p>visual programming is hard for experienced users,
because they have tools and workflows
that visual editors get in the way of.</p>
<p>being able to transition between them
means that people can view the code as they like,
and use the input methods that suit them most.
a visual programmer can assemble some code
that they can hand of to a text programmer
who can review it and make edits in their text editor.
the opposite can also be done.</p>
<p>so, let’s get into it
with the text representation.</p>
<h2 id="text-representation">text representation<a class="zola-anchor" href="#text-representation" aria-label="Anchor link for: text-representation">🔗</a></h2>
<p>this is a program that makes wallpapers
with a random image under a random quote.</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain"># make random wallpaper
let picture
	random-pick picture-list
let quote
	random-pick quote-list
let wallpaper
	draw:new [screen-width screen-height]
		draw:text quote
		draw:image picture
</span></code></pre>
<p>this is a simple syntax like a command-line meeting python,
which is inspired by s-expressions.</p>
<ul>
<li>each line is a function call</li>
<li>spaces separate items on the line</li>
<li>the first line item is the function</li>
<li>the other line items are arguments</li>
<li>indented lines are arguments
to the last less-indented line before it
(the <code>draw:text</code> call is an argument to <code>draw:new</code>,
which is an argument to <code>let wallpaper</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>in a more familiar syntax for most people:</p>
<pre class="z-code"><code><span class="z-text z-plain">let(&quot;picture&quot;,
	random-pick(picture-list)
)`
let(&quot;quote&quot;,
	random-pick(quote-list)
)`
let(&quot;wallpaper&quot;,
	draw:new([screen-width screen-height],
		draw:text(quote),
		draw:image(picture)
	)
)`
</span></code></pre>
<p>the reason i’m using the
s-expression inspired<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#not-sxp">1</a></sup> syntax
that looks like command-line-meets-python
is because it represents all constructs uniformly
with little to no visual clutter:
the first item on a line is always a function,
and the rest are always arguments to that function,
all of which are separated by spaces.</p>
<p>using this makes it trivial for the computer to transform it,
and for people to understand it —
especially across representations,
when we switch it up
with lots of whitespace and colourful shapes.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="not-sxp"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>the reason i’m not using s-expressions
is because some people really dislike them</p>
</div>
<h2 id="presenting-block-code">presenting: block code<a class="zola-anchor" href="#presenting-block-code" aria-label="Anchor link for: presenting-block-code">🔗</a></h2>
<p><img src="/program-representation-blocks.svg" alt="block code" /></p>
<p>while this might look like syntax highlighted code
with a whole lot of whitespace,
each block can be dragged around by the user.
if you’ve ever used mit scratch as a beginner,
you might know what this is like.</p>
<p>blocks help users just snap existing pieces together
a lot more like lego than typing text.</p>
<p>while this disrupts the flow of code editor users,
they don’t actually have to use the block editor,
plus great mouse support doesn’t mean bad keyboard support.</p>
<p>the block editor should include
keyboard shortcuts to add and move blocks,
and have autocomplete for node names.</p>
<p>we can pick keyboard shortcuts such that
existing text editor users can easily switch to blocks,
and block editor users can also go the opposite way:</p>
<ul>
<li>pressing space while writing a function or variable name
will create a new argument block and move to it,</li>
<li>the quote key will create a text block (“string” of characters),</li>
<li>the return key will create a new function call block,</li>
<li>the tab key will indent the line block,</li>
<li>and shift + tab will de-indent the line block.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="making-node-graphs">making node graphs<a class="zola-anchor" href="#making-node-graphs" aria-label="Anchor link for: making-node-graphs">🔗</a></h2>
<p>honestly, this is pretty exciting in itself,
but one day i just figured out something about blocks:</p>
<p><img src="/program-representation-block-nodes.svg" alt="deconstructed block code" /></p>
<p>each block has a connection to its parent block,
and variable declarations carry over to the immediate parent.</p>
<p>the other revelation is that the top-level is also a node
that accepts infinite expressions.</p>
<p><img src="/program-representation-nodes.svg" alt="node code" /></p>
<p>while nodes can become sprawling and hard to read,
they do have some benefits.</p>
<p>nodes can include custom ui
without breaking the flow.
imagine a colour wheel for a node
that creates a colour type,
or a carousel of images for a list of them.</p>
