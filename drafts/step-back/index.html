<hr>

<p>When something loses balance,
you attempt to fix it,
but then something else falls out
so you rush back to fix it,
but then something else topples over,
which you run over to fix,
and soon enough everything is crashing down around you.</p>
<p>The issue here is with your framework,
the bones of your project.</p>
<p>If you’re drawing,
draw it again separately.
Don’t erase bits and draw over your existing drawing.
Practice in a notebook.
Try to make the basic forms and proportions.
Go back to your canvas after you get it right.</p>
<p>If you’re writing, write it again separately.
Or just copy the offending part
and edit it with the previous version in view.</p>
<p>If you’re coding,
consider re-writing the whole thing
or the offending code from scratch.</p>
<p>There are exceptions of course.
Sometimes, re-writing costs too much.
This is especially true of larger pieces of work.
The first step to editing a larger piece
is to understand the overall work,
either by cleaning it up,
or making a model of some kind.
Then if the pieces still don’t fit,
you need to revise your model,
and see if you need to redo or if you can edit.</p>
<p>In a drawing piece,
take a step back and consider your piece.
Maybe make rough sketches.
Then head back to your piece.</p>
<p>When trying to edit some writing,
consider only one aspect at a time,
such as grammar, paragraph structure,
chapter structure, or section structure.
Once it’s all laid out neatly,
then you try modifying the whole flow of the book.
I can’t say for sure, however,
since I tend to write short-medium
non-fiction articles.</p>
