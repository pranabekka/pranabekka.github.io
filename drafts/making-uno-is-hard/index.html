<hr>

<p>You should try making it yourself.
I chose it as a “simple” project
to have something other than endless tutorials,
but it actually took me several months
(probably because I’m a total beginner).</p>
<h2 id="the-journey">The journey<a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-journey" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-journey">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I started out with generating the deck,
then dealing cards to a player,
making styles for layouts and cards,
and finally coming around to modeling the game proper.</p>
<p>At this stage I started out trying to hook it up
with my deck generation and dealing logic,
before I had to stop and starting taking notes.</p>
<h3 id="the-tough-bit">The tough bit<a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-tough-bit" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-tough-bit">🔗</a></h3>
<p>I needed to know what information
the game would need for validation,
the exact rules we play by,
and solutions to all the edge cases that might occur,
for which I even asked some family members.</p>
<p>For example, think of a turn where
you challenge the previous player, who played a draw 4,
and you succeed, then you pick a card
(to match the colour they chose?),
and then you play the card you picked,
because it’s a valid card to play.</p>
<p>Or consider how you’ll allow anyone to catch
the last player to finish their turn
if they forgot to say UNO
(assuming you play by those rules).</p>
<h3 id="giving-up">Giving up<a class="zola-anchor" href="#giving-up" aria-label="Anchor link for: giving-up">🔗</a></h3>
<p>I made several small prototypes,
with variables like drawSum, isActive,
direction, currentPlayer, currentPlayerIdx,
discardPile, initialPlayers, prevCard, and more.</p>
<p>On top of that, I had to figure out project architecture,
because this is my biggest project by a significant margin,
so I gave up at that point, focussing on other things
and trying to process it in the back of my mind.</p>
<h3 id="an-undo-system">An undo system<a class="zola-anchor" href="#an-undo-system" aria-label="Anchor link for: an-undo-system">🔗</a></h3>
<p>I finally started again after two or three months,
when I figured that I could remove all validation.
Even after the idea entered my occassional pondering,
it took me some time before I could accept it.</p>
<p>I think, if I were to do it again,
I’d store all the validation state in variables,
and the cards would be a separate system
that interact with validation state
at one or two places like placement and starting turn.
Maybe I’d also go for a server-client structure.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The game<a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-game" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-game">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I eventually landed on a peer-to-peer system,
with a server hosting the pages and passing messages:</p>
<div class="border-images">
  <p><img src="/juan-cards-2.png" alt="juan-cards started game" /></p>
<p>Players need to see what’s on the discard pile,
a general sequence of players <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>,
along with the number of cards in their hand,
a history to track what cards were played,
and their hand, of course.
Because there’s no validation,
there’s also an ‘Undo’ button.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>though the screenshot only shows 1 :p</p>
</div>
<p><img src="/juan-cards-0.png" alt="juan-cards lobby" /></p>
<p>The login page is actually stupidly simple —
it redirects you to <code>/u/{user-name}</code>,
and the game logic reads the user-name from the URL.
They basically have no relation to each other.
You could skip past the login page to join.</p>
<p><img src="/juan-cards-1.png" alt="juan-cards unstarted game" /></p>
<p>Until the game is started, there’s a ‘Start’ button,
which disappears when you press it.</p>
<!-- TODO: add draw dialog -->
</div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Overall, I’m quite happy that I finished this project,
even if I don’t have any validation.</p>
<p>The undo system actually works quite well,
because people don’t actually think of cheating,
and I’m playing with people who I’ve played
with in-person, using physical cards,
which has basically the same mechanics.</p>
<p>As for the peer-to-peer architecture,
I chose it because I found it easier to conceptualise
a single type of entity talking to more of its type,
instead of trying to figure out the server/client divide.</p>
<h2 id="try-the-official-uno-2-go-by-mattel">Try the official UNO 2 GO by Mattel<a class="zola-anchor" href="#try-the-official-uno-2-go-by-mattel" aria-label="Anchor link for: try-the-official-uno-2-go-by-mattel">🔗</a></h2>
<p>By the way,
you should install UNO 2 GO on your respective
(mobile) app store.</p>
<p>When you first start the game,
make sure to keep sounds on and don’t skip anything.</p>
<h2 id="additional-implementation-notes">Additional implementation notes<a class="zola-anchor" href="#additional-implementation-notes" aria-label="Anchor link for: additional-implementation-notes">🔗</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>4 types of messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>join: -</li>
<li>playerList: -</li>
<li>start: -</li>
<li>draw: -</li>
<li>play: -</li>
<li>undo: -</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I simply redraw whole ‘components’
if their data model changes.
It’s basically instant,
and anything more complex would take more time.</p>
<p>‘Components’ include the hand, player list, and history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cards have an ID, because I wanted to track
which card should be moved —
if somebody has two green 2s,
the one they press should be the one that moves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aspect-ratio: quite useful,
except on a particularly old phone
which we had to resurect to fill in for another
that met its untimely demise.
Even then it worked well enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many divs, just to make styling easier.
I didn’t want to deal with browser specific button styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history scrolls automatically.
Maybe I should include a video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight self in player list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three letter names to fit many easily.
Also, old video games used to do that,
which is fun, plus it works well enough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="todo">TODO<a class="zola-anchor" href="#todo" aria-label="Anchor link for: todo">🔗</a></h2>
<p>There’s a few things that could be used
to improve the game right now,
and a few ideas I’m considering for after
I’ve progressed further in the tutorial <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p><a href="https://javascript.info">javascript.info</a>, btw.
It’s free, concise, comprehensive, and includes good exercises.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Highlight the last player to play or draw a card.
This should make it easier to track the game,
because it can be hard to parse the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw arrows in player list,
and change direction if play card value is reverse.
Will need to account for it in undo as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlight if new card on discard pile doesn’t match old.
Only if it’s particularly hard to track,
but I find the idea of (lighthearted) cheating fun —
we usually don’t take UNO too seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a host/join architecture.
I ended up watching two tutorials on Godot networking,
which showed servers just being a specialised peer,
so that was interesting.
That would also make lots of things easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try peer-js. They have a free server for passing messages,
so I could play online with people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle disconnects.
This would probably require a server-client implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
