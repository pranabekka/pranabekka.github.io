<p>[<strong>DRAFT</strong>]
I want to play the ukulele, but not just that —
I want to <em>understand</em> what I’m doing,
instead of just pressing my fingers on the strings
like a good monkey.
So this is an overview of various concepts
and things that caught my attention,
and I think it might give context
to other people as well.</p>
<p><strong>DRAFT</strong>:<br />
- might need better organisation,<br />
- less abrupt language<br />
- like, why does it start with piano keys?<br />
because it’s easier to read than ukulele strings?<br />
- better explanation of diagrams</p>
<p><img src="/music-c-major-scale-keyboard.svg" alt="keyboard" /></p>
<p>12 notes:
<code>C</code>  <code>C#</code>  <code>D</code>  <code>D#</code>  <code>E</code>  <code>F</code>  <code>F#</code>  <code>G</code>  <code>G#</code>  <code>A</code>  <code>A#</code>  <code>B</code>
(# is for “sharp”)</p>
<p>The standard ukulele tuning uses the C major scale
(shown in the images).
In this arrangement,
the ukulele strings (from left to right)
are <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>E</code>, and <code>A</code> (pictured below).</p>
<p><img src="/music-c-major-scale-ukulele.svg" alt="ukulele" /></p>
<p>When you press down on a fret,
you move the note up by the number of frets.
So, the first fret on the G string is G#,
the second fret is A, and the third fret is A#.
(“Sharps for all, but B and E.” — me)</p>
<h2 id="learning-exercises">Learning exercises<a class="zola-anchor" href="#learning-exercises" aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-exercises">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Play the first four frets for each string one at a time,
with two strums for the fourth fret with the little finger.
This is a good way to strengthen the tips of your fingers,
and to warm up as well.</p>
<p>First: index;<br />
second: middle;<br />
third: ring;<br />
fourth: little</p>
<p>Focus on short stretches of 10–15 minutes in the beginning.
At least once a day.</p>
<h2 id="tuning">Tuning<a class="zola-anchor" href="#tuning" aria-label="Anchor link for: tuning">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Use any tuning app or website.
There’s lots of them,
though some are easier to understand and use.
UkuTabs seems to have a good one:
<a href="https://ukutabs.com/ukulele-tuner/">https://ukutabs.com/ukulele-tuner/</a></p>
<p>Other options include an instrument,
a digital tuner, and ???
See the UkuTabs article</p>
<p>//// potential reasons for including this tuning
making the various notes (in c major scale) accessible
see in the piano-ukulele diagram,
how the high one lands on the g in the octave</p>
<h3 id="high-g">“High G”<a class="zola-anchor" href="#high-g" aria-label="Anchor link for: high-g">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The G is usually tuned at a higher pitch:
two notes higher (later) than the A string
(or 3 notes higher than the E string;
see ukulele diagram).</p>
<p>The other option is “low G”: tuning the G
five notes lower (earlier/deeper) than the C string,
for more bass.</p>
<p><img src="/music-c-major-scale-keyboard-ukulele-relation.svg" alt="ukulele-strings-on-piano" /></p>
<p>This (in the above image)
is how the notes map to a sequence on a keyboard,
when using “high G” tuning.
The G, C, E, and A are marked
the same way as in the ukulele diagram.</p>
<p>If you used “low G”,
you’d be in a lower octave,
off the left side of the diagram,
which can have its uses.</p>
<h2 id="posture">Posture<a class="zola-anchor" href="#posture" aria-label="Anchor link for: posture">🔗</a></h2>
<p>If you’re standing,
hold it to your body with the forearm of your strumming hand.</p>
<p>If you’re sitting, you can rest it on your thigh.</p>
<p>Put the thumb of your fretting hand
on the back of the fretboard,
not hooked around it.</p>
<h2 id="more-theory">More theory<a class="zola-anchor" href="#more-theory" aria-label="Anchor link for: more-theory">🔗</a></h2>
<h3 id="chords">Chords<a class="zola-anchor" href="#chords" aria-label="Anchor link for: chords">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Chords are simply a collection of notes played together. </p>
<p>They’re named after the most prominent note in the chord.</p>
<!--
See the Chords document for more, including the different chords.
-->
<h3 id="octave-main-notes">Octave (main notes)<a class="zola-anchor" href="#octave-main-notes" aria-label="Anchor link for: octave-main-notes">🔗</a></h3>
<p>8 notes in an octave.</p>
<p><code>A</code>  <code>B</code>  <code>C</code>  <code>D</code>  <code>E</code>  <code>F</code>  <code>G</code>  <code>A</code></p>
<p>First and last are given the same name,
but the last one has twice the frequency of the first one.</p>
<p>Octaves repeat — think “going up an octave”.</p>
<p>Do Re Mi is also an octave. It even repeats the Do.</p>
<p><code>Do</code>  <code>Re</code>  <code>Mi</code>  <code>Fa</code>  <code>So</code>  <code>La</code>  <code>Ti</code>  <code>Do</code></p>
<h3 id="starting-with-c">Starting with C?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#starting-with-c" aria-label="Anchor link for: starting-with-c">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Notes start with C instead of A
because most western music uses the C major scale,
which begins with C.
It is also the only major scale
that doesn’t have any flats/sharps (maybe).</p>
<h3 id="sharp-and-flat">♯ (sharp) and ♭ (flat)?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#sharp-and-flat" aria-label="Anchor link for: sharp-and-flat">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Sharps and flats are half notes
higher or lower than the main ones.
Sharps are a half note higher,
and flats are a half note lower.
C♯ (C sharp/#) is the same as D♭ (D flat),
in terms of the note/finger placement
(after C, before D; see the diagrams).</p>
<p>Sharps and flats came about over time
as musicians wanted notes
just a little bit lower or higher in pitch
than the main notes.</p>
<p>All notes but B and E have sharp notes:
<code>C</code>  <code>C#</code>  <code>D</code>  <code>D#</code>  <code>E</code>  <code>F</code>  <code>F#</code>  <code>G</code>  <code>G#</code>  <code>A</code>  <code>A#</code>  <code>B</code></p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions<a class="zola-anchor" href="#questions" aria-label="Anchor link for: questions">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Questions labelled “Uku” are ukulele specific (as far as I know)</p>
<h3 id="uku-what-s-a-suspended-chord-augmented-dominant-major-minor">Uku: What’s a suspended chord? Augmented? Dominant? Major? Minor?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#uku-what-s-a-suspended-chord-augmented-dominant-major-minor" aria-label="Anchor link for: uku-what-s-a-suspended-chord-augmented-dominant-major-minor">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Also, what do the numbers mean?
Speaking from the UkuTabs chord article.
Maybe the numbers are octaves.</p>
<h3 id="does-standard-tuning-start-at-the-4th-octave-why">Does standard tuning start at the 4th octave? Why?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#does-standard-tuning-start-at-the-4th-octave-why" aria-label="Anchor link for: does-standard-tuning-start-at-the-4th-octave-why">🔗</a></h3>
<p>I’ve seen an example mention C4,
which I think means 4th octave,
since the final note was C5.</p>
<h3 id="do-notes-not-come-out-at-lower-octaves-do-they-sound-bad">Do notes not come out at lower octaves? Do they sound bad?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#do-notes-not-come-out-at-lower-octaves-do-they-sound-bad" aria-label="Anchor link for: do-notes-not-come-out-at-lower-octaves-do-they-sound-bad">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Does the 4th octave match the pitch of human voices?
Or contrast it with just the right amount (like Goldilocks)?</p>
<h3 id="what-is-frequency-especially-regarding-a-note-pitch-octave">What is frequency, especially regarding a note/pitch/octave?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-is-frequency-especially-regarding-a-note-pitch-octave" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-is-frequency-especially-regarding-a-note-pitch-octave">🔗</a></h3>
<p>If the last note of an octave is twice the frequency of the first,
then what does that mean in terms of pitch?
I guess higher frequency means higher pitch —
a more “pure” and “shrill” sound.</p>
<h3 id="are-notes-only-differentiated-by-pitch">Are notes only differentiated by pitch?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#are-notes-only-differentiated-by-pitch" aria-label="Anchor link for: are-notes-only-differentiated-by-pitch">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Same for octaves, sharps, flats, and harmonics?
Also, does pitch only refer to how “shrill” or deep a sound is?
I guess notes are a little more complicated,
given the Wikipedia article intro —
it says notes include duration.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-the-scale-skip-notes-in-the-way-that-it-does">Why does the scale skip notes in the way that it does?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#why-does-the-scale-skip-notes-in-the-way-that-it-does" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-does-the-scale-skip-notes-in-the-way-that-it-does">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Why does it require starting key (C),
skip key (C#), next key (D), skip key (D#),
next key (E), next key (F), and so on?
Also, why is it called a “scale”?</p>
<h3 id="why-are-flats-not-required-for-c-and-f">Why are flats not required for C and F?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#why-are-flats-not-required-for-c-and-f" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-are-flats-not-required-for-c-and-f">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Or, why are sharps not required for B and E?
By now those should have developed as well.
Is it because the notes sound fine as is?
What’s not fine about the others?</p>
<h3 id="what-s-a-harmonic">What’s a harmonic?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-s-a-harmonic" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-s-a-harmonic">🔗</a></h3>
<p>I came across it somewhere
while reading up on ukuleles and music on Wikipedia.
Something to do with octaves?</p>
<h3 id="is-there-a-pattern-to-which-notes-are-prominent-in-a-chord">Is there a pattern to which notes are prominent in a chord?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#is-there-a-pattern-to-which-notes-are-prominent-in-a-chord" aria-label="Anchor link for: is-there-a-pattern-to-which-notes-are-prominent-in-a-chord">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Could you figure out the notes in a chord just from the name?
Or the name of a chord just from the notes?</p>
