<p>UNO with a “battle pass” and Balatro’s game feel
could reach the same peaks as Candy Crush and Wordle.</p>
<p>Battle passes are a staple in free shooter games,
where they offer character outfits, weapon modifications,
kill and winning animations, and more,
with a premium paid tier for higher quality unlocks.
UNO can offer card styles, banners, stickers,
player avatars, badges,
special action and winning animations, and so on.</p>
<p>I also mentioned Balatro because it won
Indie Game of the Year,
every clip I’ve seen of it has great animations,
and it’s built upon a well-known card game, poker,
which is likely second in popularity only to UNO.
There’s also a slew of other (indie) card games
with incredible animations and game feel.</p>

<h2 id="a-potential-issue">A potential issue<a class="zola-anchor" href="#a-potential-issue" aria-label="Anchor link for: a-potential-issue">🔗</a></h2>
<p>One key difference between UNO
and games with battle passes
is that those games offer upgrades
that affect core gameplay.
They interact with the rules of the game.</p>
<p>So far we’ve discussed changes outside the main game,
such as cosmetics and clubs,
which might lose players like water in a sieve.</p>
<p>We could unlock new game modes,
but those extra modes often have long waiting times
because most people go to the main game mode,
especially if the waiting time for extra modes
is longer than what they’re used to.
You would also need to unlock all modes pretty soon,
otherwise you’ll frustrate the players
who got the game for those modes.</p>
<p>We would want something that’s only for the player
who unlocked the feature,
but doesn’t give a direct advantage,
instead adding interesting twists.
Perhaps something that also has costs for the player.</p>
<p>One viable solution is something like “air drop” cards.
At the beginning of the match
players will get to pick a special card,
and during the match they can pick up an “air drop” card
that would turn into their special card.
Players would start with only a single special card to use,
and then they’d unlock more options as they play.
This is quite similar to Helldivers, Hades,
and other rogue-lite games.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience<a class="zola-anchor" href="#audience" aria-label="Anchor link for: audience">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I briefly mentioned Candy Crush and Wordle in the beginning.
Like them, UNO is a game for all kinds of people
from all walks of life.</p>
<p>It’s for families, friends, acquaintances, colleagues, and more.</p>
<p>You might spot people on the train playing UNO.
Maybe someone has earphones plugged in
and is talking to their friends or family as they play.</p>
<p>That’s one of the main reasons I think this idea is so viable.</p>
<p>However, unlike Candy Crush and Wordle,
UNO is already well-known across the world,
and this would give it a new breath of life.</p>
<h2 id="another-possible-problem">Another possible problem<a class="zola-anchor" href="#another-possible-problem" aria-label="Anchor link for: another-possible-problem">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Given the audience the game is meant for,
especially people playing it in their down time,
there should be a way to make matches shorter.</p>
<p>This can be done using special cards or rules,
such as a timer for the match.</p>
<p>If nobody wins before the timer is over <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#animate">1</a></sup>,
whoever has the lowest total card value wins <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#value">2</a></sup>.
This is inspired by the tournament rules
given with the physical cards.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="animate"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Remember to animate it as well!</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="value"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Number cards use that as the value,
coloured action cards are 20, and wild cards are 40.
Add up all the points and hope yours is the lowest.</p>
</div>
<!--
this adds an interesting aspect to the game,
where you want to discard action cards quickly,
but you also want to keep the draw cards around
for stacking on a draw card played on you.
-->
<p>Experimentation and play-tests
might reveal other options.</p>
<h2 id="it-doesn-t-need-to-be-uno">It doesn’t need to be UNO<a class="zola-anchor" href="#it-doesn-t-need-to-be-uno" aria-label="Anchor link for: it-doesn-t-need-to-be-uno">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Balatro’s example could be followed more directly,
but building a multiplayer poker game instead,
though poker has a steeper learning curve
and negative associations —
since we don’t want people to actually gamble,
players would bet the coins and cards they get in-game,
so that there’s still a sense of investment in every round.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t need to be poker, either.
It doesn’t need to be any pre-existing card game.</p>
<p>People could launch their own
player-versus-player card game
if they can keep up with the content demands.</p>
<p>It won’t have the same power as UNO,
but they could still win big,
and I’d love that for indie devs.</p>
<p>If you’ve been noodling on a cool card game design,
go make it!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">🔗</a></h2>
<p>We have a future award-winning, money-making,
viral hit in our hands.</p>
<p>Someone please reach out to Mattel, or your management,
if you already work there, to get this off the ground.</p>
<p>I beg thee.</p>
<p>Hand this lowly one word from above.
That troops are being mustered.
That the tall blonde himbo rides out for battle.</p>
<p>:)</p>
