<p>// TODO: also make class notes for things to cover tomorrow
// - illustration of “computer language” being translated to app views
// - phone files (including the app to view them)
// - camera app</p>
<p>Laptops, desktops and phones have two main concepts:
files and apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Files have your data inside them.
The words, pictures, and lists from your mind
go inside files on a computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apps are used to open, change and create files.
They can understand different file types
and show them in a way humans understand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Files are written in a language
that the computer understands.
Every file has a different type,
which is a different computer language.
Different apps understand different types (“languages”).
Some apps only <em>read</em> some files,
and others can read <em>and write</em> files.</p>
<p><img src="https://pranabekka.github.io/drafts/files-and-apps/" alt="TODO: file “languages” like text and picture being translated" /></p>
<p>For example, a photos app only “reads”
the file types (“languages”) used for photos,
but it cannot “write” a new photo file (“language”).
To “write” a photo file type, you need a camera app.</p>
<p>You can see files in the “File Explorer” app.
To see the file <em>type</em>, change the “View” to “Details”.</p>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: file explorer app</p>
<p>To find an app, you can open the Start Menu
and start typing the name of the app.
You can also see all apps by
clicking the “All Apps” button
on the top right of the Start Menu.</p>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: apps, files, and file types on phone</p>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: file paths</p>
<h3 id="phone-files">Phone files<a class="zola-anchor" href="#phone-files" aria-label="Anchor link for: phone-files">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Even your phones has a “Files” app.
It uses the same types of files,
but slightly different folders.</p>
<p>Look for the “Files” app on your phone,
and try to find the folders for
“Downloads”, “Documents”, “DCIM”, and “Whatsapp”.
(“DCIM” means “Digital Camera IMages”)</p>
<p>Some apps show the files to you,
so that you can share them
or open them in other apps easily,
but other apps don’t show files.</p>
<h2 id="important-file-types-languages">Important file types (“languages”)<a class="zola-anchor" href="#important-file-types-languages" aria-label="Anchor link for: important-file-types-languages">🔗</a></h2>
<h3 id="file-folder">File Folder<a class="zola-anchor" href="#file-folder" aria-label="Anchor link for: file-folder">🔗</a></h3>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: file folder icon</p>
<p>Also called “Folder”.</p>
<p>Folders have other files inside them.
They are opened in File Explorer.
All files must be inside a folder.</p>
<p>File explorer always shows you what is inside a folder.
The name of the folder is on the top left, and in the Path Bar.
To open a file inside the current folder,
you have to double click on the file.
(A folder is also a file, with the type “File Folder”).
When you open the Downloads folder,
you will see “Downloads” on the top left,
and in the Path Bar.</p>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: path bar</p>
<p>The type of “Downloads” file is “File Folder”.
Think of other files that have more files inside them.
Those are all folders.</p>
<p>Remember, a folder is a type of file.
So a folder can contain other folders,
and it is always in another folder.
The main folder is “This PC”.
It is not inside another folder,
but all other folders and files
are inside another folder.</p>
<h3 id="png-and-jpg-jpeg">PNG and JPG/JPEG<a class="zola-anchor" href="#png-and-jpg-jpeg" aria-label="Anchor link for: png-and-jpg-jpeg">🔗</a></h3>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: png/jpg icon</p>
<p>These are file types for pictures.</p>
<p>When you take a photo with the camera,
it creates a file with the type “JPG” or “JPEG”.</p>
<p>It will name the file something like “20241111”,
which means year 2024, month 11 (november), date 11
— 11th November 2024.
Look in the Pictures folder for camera images.</p>
<p>You can also create images with Paint (app).</p>
<h3 id="word-document">(Word) Document<a class="zola-anchor" href="#word-document" aria-label="Anchor link for: word-document">🔗</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://pranabekka.github.io/drafts/files-and-apps/" alt="TODO: “document” image and/or illustration" /></p>
<p>A Document type is for things like
letters, exam papers, and books.</p>
<p>Word is also the name of an app
that reads and writes Documents,
which is why Document is also called Word Document.</p>
<p>!!!! <strong>TODO</strong>: word document icon</p>
<p>When you create a file from Word,
it saves it in the Documents folder by default,
but you can choose another folder with “Browse”.</p>
<h3 id="powerpoint-presentation">(Powerpoint) Presentation<a class="zola-anchor" href="#powerpoint-presentation" aria-label="Anchor link for: powerpoint-presentation">🔗</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://pranabekka.github.io/drafts/files-and-apps/" alt="TODO: slide deck image and illustration" /></p>
<p>A presentation is like a chalkboard,
or lots of chart papers for each chalkboard drawing.</p>
<p>Each “chart paper” is called a slide.
Slides can contain text and images of various types,
as well as lists, tables, graphs, and more.</p>
<p>The default app for presentation type files is Powerpoint.
That is why the file type is also called “Powerpoint Presentation”.</p>
<h3 id="excel-worksheet">(Excel) Worksheet<a class="zola-anchor" href="#excel-worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: excel-worksheet">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Worksheet files store data about tables.
All the data is organised into rows and columns.</p>
<p>The default app for worksheet type files is Excel.
That is why the file type is also called “Excel Worksheet”.</p>
<h3 id="compressed-folder">Compressed Folder<a class="zola-anchor" href="#compressed-folder" aria-label="Anchor link for: compressed-folder">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: zip folder icon</p>
<p>Compressed folders fit files into a smaller space.
It is like putting lots of things inside a bag
and pushing it inside to close the zip.</p>
