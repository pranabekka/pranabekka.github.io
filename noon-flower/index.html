<p>Imagine if <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>
were 2D — and top-down,
instead of sidescrolling (Terraria, Starbound).
Something like <a href="http://cross-code.com/en/home">CrossCode</a>,
but with building and more emergent gameplay.</p>
<p>(Noon-Flower was previously called Wijo)</p>
<p>There are two core ideas behind this:
It must be compelling, and it must be tractable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A compelling game is something multiplayer
that I can play with friends.
Something that allows different kinds of gameplay.
Something that allows you to own it.
Something accessible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A tractable game is something that can be achieved,
even if I don’t have the skills (right now or ever).
2D pixel art should speed up ideating, prototyping,
and the “final” implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the key reason Minecraft is so successful
is that it enables a gradient of game to game engine.
You can just play the game as is,
or you switch some of the toggles
to make certain parts easier or harder.
Maybe you add a few nice to have features to the game.
Or maybe you <a href="https://ctmrepository.com/index.php?action=viewMap&amp;id=469">change the game entirely</a>
— you add grand structures, limit exploration,
add new items with different effects,
add new creatures with different abilities,
and add a new magic system.
That’s the power of Minecraft.</p>
<p>So at an overall view, I want a base game,
along with a system for scripting and adding custom content.
You should be able to implement a puzzle game, a PvP game,
maybe a shooter, an RPG, an MMO game (?), a roguelike, and more.
Maybe a simple farming simulator as well.</p>
<p>The base game will be open world,
with procedurally generated terrain.
I imagine people exploring and creating bases together.
I imagine them visiting villages, towns and cities
populated by new and interesting races.
I imagine them raiding dungeons
and fighting terrible creatures.
I imagine players meeting creatures and
accepting quests for interesting rewards.</p>
<p>I recommend everyone to try out
<a href="http://cross-code.com/en/home">CrossCode</a>’s free demo,
to see an example of compelling 2D gameplay
that’s actually quite 3 dimensional.
They have a very interesting parkour system,
as well as a nice combat system.</p>
