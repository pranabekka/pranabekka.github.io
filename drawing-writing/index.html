<p>Drawing and writing are essential tools for thinking.
Because they are loose and unstructured,
they allow you to capture thoughts with the least friction;
and capturing thoughts quickly and smoothly is essential for
completing, developing, and refining ideas.</p>
<p>You can write and draw with a notebook and pen,
or you could use your smartphone.
You could use a tablet if you want to capture
a lot of sketches digitally, and enable easy
reorganisation and search of text and other material.
Use a physical keyboard if you’re writing a lot,
since keyboards can capture words faster than pens.</p>
<p>This applies to most endeavours.
You might be thinking of a new piece of furniture,
or a topic you want to compile material on,
or figuring out how to organise something,
or designing the interface for an application.</p>
<p>These are all creative pursuits, by the way.
A mathematician exploring new principles and ideas
is just as creative as a painter exploring
new brushes and subject materials.</p>
<p>This might all be feeling like an epiphany to me
purely because I’m a little sleep deprived.
Oh, well.</p>
